If you want to know more about the plot and the characters of Insidious: The Last Key, here is a brief summary of the movie:
 
The movie begins with a flashback to Elise's childhood in 1953, where she lives with her parents and her brother Christian in a house that is connected to the Further, a realm of spirits and demons. Elise has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, but her father Gerald, who works as a prison executioner, does not believe her and abuses her for it. One night, Elise encounters a demonic entity called Key Face, who tricks her into opening a door that unleashes evil spirits into the house. Gerald locks Elise in the basement as punishment, where she is attacked by Key Face. She manages to escape and runs away from home, leaving behind her brother and a whistle that he gave her.
 
In 2010, Elise is a renowned paranormal investigator who works with her assistants Specs and Tucker. She receives a phone call from Ted Garza, who claims to be living in her childhood home and experiencing supernatural phenomena. Elise decides to take the case and returns to her hometown of Five Keys, New Mexico. She reunites with her estranged brother Christian, who is still angry at her for abandoning him. She also meets his daughters Melissa and Imogen, who have inherited Elise's psychic abilities.
 
Elise and her team enter the house and discover that it is still haunted by Key Face and other spirits. They also find a secret room where Gerald used to torture and kill prisoners. Elise realizes that Key Face has been manipulating Garza into kidnapping and murdering women in the house. She confronts Garza and tries to free one of his captives, but Key Face kills Garza and possesses Elise. He then kills Melissa by breaking her neck.
 
Imogen, who has a strong connection with Elise, enters the Further with Specs and Tucker's help. She finds Elise's spirit and helps her break free from Key Face's control. They also encounter the spirits of Gerald, Elise's mother Audrey, and Melissa. Audrey gives Elise the whistle that Christian gave her as a child. Elise confronts Key Face again and uses the whistle to summon her father's spirit, who apologizes for his actions and helps Elise fight Key Face. Elise blows the whistle again and destroys Key Face with a burst of light.
 
Elise and Imogen return to the real world and reunite with their family and friends. Elise reconciles with Christian and gives him the whistle. She also tells Imogen that she has a gift and that she should use it wisely. Elise then receives a phone call from a woman named Lorraine Lambert, who asks for her help with her son Josh, who is being haunted by a red-faced demon. This sets up the events of the first Insidious movie.
